# fleet

A multi-agent orchestrator for [cmux](https://github.com/manaflow-ai/cmux). One
Claude Code session becomes an **orchestrator** that launches, steers, and
monitors a fleet of **worker** Claude Code sessions — each in its own cmux pane,
all running under your **Max plan** ($0 per token, no API key).

It's the [pi-style multi-agent rig from the cmux demo](https://youtu.be/8jDXI4_rJOE),
rebuilt as a thin CLI you drive from any project in plain language.

```
You ⇄ Claude Code (orchestrator)         ← your Max session
        │  loads the `fleet` skill
        ▼
      fleet spawn / grid / read / send / watch / status / kill
        │  (wraps the cmux CLI + Unix socket)
        ▼
      cmux ⇄ worker Claude Code sessions  ← same Max session, isolated workspaces
        ▲                              │
        └── notification feed ─────────┘  (deterministic "turn done" signal)
                  ▲
      fleet daemon (always-on heartbeat) ── escalates to you when something needs attention
```

## Why

cmux is a scriptable, GPU-accelerated terminal (workspaces → panes → surfaces)
with a JSON-RPC socket — but it is *not* an orchestrator. `fleet` is the
control layer: it turns the verbs cmux exposes (`new-workspace`, `new-split`,
`send`, `read-screen`, `notification.list`, …) into a small, stable command set
an orchestrating Claude can reason over, plus a persistent registry of who's
doing what.

## Requirements

- macOS with the **cmux app** running (`cmux` CLI on `PATH`)
- **Node 20+** (uses `tsx`, no build step)
- **Claude Code** logged into a Pro/Max/Team subscription (workers inherit it)

## Install

```bash
npm install
ln -s "$PWD/bin/fleet" ~/.local/bin/fleet      # put `fleet` on PATH
ln -sfn "$PWD/skills/fleet" ~/.claude/skills/fleet   # let any Claude session discover it
```

`fleet` runs from any directory; each project gets its own isolated fleet
(keyed off the git root / cwd, override with `FLEET_SESSION`).

## Quickstart

Inside a Claude Code session running in a cmux workspace, just say what you want
— the `fleet` skill teaches Claude the loop. Or use the CLI directly:

```bash
fleet spawn --label api "build the REST API in src/api"   # autonomous, classifier-guarded
fleet status                                              # live fleet table
fleet watch                                               # block until the fleet is idle
fleet read api                                            # peek at a worker's screen
fleet send api "use zod for request validation"           # steer it mid-flight
fleet grid 2x2                                            # video-style swarm: 4 panes, 1 workspace
fleet kill --all                                          # tear everything down
```

## Commands

| Command | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `fleet spawn <task>` | Launch a worker in its own workspace on a task |
| `fleet grid <C>x<R> [task]` | Tile one workspace into a grid of worker panes (shared FS) |
| `fleet status` | Snapshot the fleet (state per agent) |
| `fleet watch` | Block until the fleet is idle; prints transitions + sidebar dashboard |
| `fleet read <agent>` | Capture a worker's terminal screen |
| `fleet send <agent> <text>` | Type into a worker (steer it) |
| `fleet kill <agent\|--all>` | Stop a worker and clean up its pane/workspace |
| `fleet resume` | Reconcile the registry against live cmux (prune dead, refresh refs) |
| `fleet daemon <start\|stop\|status>` | Always-on heartbeat supervisor |
| `fleet notify-orchestrator <msg> [--urgent]` | Push a message to the orchestrator |

Agents are matched by id, id-prefix, or label.

## Permission modes

Workers map onto Claude Code's permission modes:

- **`auto`** (default) — autonomous, but Claude Code's classifier blocks
  dangerous actions (deploys, `curl | bash`, force-push, mass deletes, secret
  exfil). The right default for almost everything.
- **`--gated`** — prompts on every risky action; for sensitive work.
- **`--yolo`** — `--dangerously-skip-permissions`, no checks. Sandboxes only.

Cost is **plan quota, not dollars** — N parallel Opus workers draw on your
shared 5-hour/weekly Max limits, so keep concurrency modest.

## How a worker's "done" is detected

cmux's wrapped Claude Code emits a notification when a worker's turn ends
(`Completed in <dir>` / `Waiting`), keyed to its `workspace_id`. `fleet` reads
that feed (`notification.list`) for a **deterministic** idle signal, with a
screen-text heuristic as fallback and `lastDispatchAt` guarding against
stale notifications from a previous turn.

## The daemon

`fleet daemon start` runs a token-free heartbeat in its own cmux pane (modeled
on the openclaw / Hermes gateway). Each beat it reconciles the fleet, refreshes
the sidebar, auto-clears stuck `--yolo` bypass dialogs, and **escalates anything
that needs you** — `awaiting-input`, stuck/zombie, error, or rate-limited:

- **urgent** + orchestrator idle → injected as a new turn in your pane
- otherwise → appended to `~/.fleet/daemon/inbox.md` (check it at turn start)

Scheduling is left to Claude Code's `/schedule`; a scheduled routine does its
work with `fleet …` and calls `fleet notify-orchestrator` to report back through
the same channel.

## Architecture

```
src/
  cli.ts            # arg parsing → command dispatch
  cmux.ts           # typed wrapper over the cmux CLI/socket (the only place we shell out)
  registry.ts       # ~/.fleet/<session>.json — who's doing what (per project)
  status.ts         # screen-heuristic classifier (running/idle/awaiting/…)
  notifications.ts  # cmux notification feed → deterministic turn-end signal
  dashboard.ts      # mirror fleet state to the cmux sidebar (set-status/progress)
  commands/         # spawn, grid, read, send, status, watch, kill, resume, daemon, notify
  daemon/           # config, inbox, channel, policy, loop (the heartbeat supervisor)
skills/fleet/SKILL.md   # teaches an orchestrating Claude the spawn→monitor→steer loop
```

**Addressing note (hard-won):** workers are addressed by `--workspace <uuid>
--surface <uuid>` together. `--workspace` alone resolves to the focused pane's
selected surface, which breaks once a workspace also holds a browser surface
("Surface is not a terminal"); `--surface` alone is unreliable. UUIDs are used
throughout because `workspace:N`/`surface:N` refs renumber as workspaces churn.

## Development

```bash
npm run typecheck          # tsc --noEmit
./bin/fleet <command>      # run via tsx, no build step
```
